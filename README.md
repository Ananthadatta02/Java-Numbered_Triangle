# Java-Numbered_Triangle
This Java program prints a numbered triangle pattern. It takes an integer n as input and prints n rows. The outer loop runs from 1 to n, while the inner loop prints numbers from 1 to the current row index. Each row starts at 1, forming a right-angled triangle with incrementing numbers.
